# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 7, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Remove duplicates from sorted array. Reverse a string provided as an array.

**Thoughts:** This was fairly straightforward.  READ THE NOTES CAREFULLY. Splice method needs more attention.
Reversing a string was more about cheesing the test than learning anything. The fastest test response ignored the test instruction and returned the reverse function, which was faster than not returning anything.

### Day 2: June 8, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Delete a node in a linked list. Max Depth of Binary Tree

**Thoughts:** I overcomplicated linked list a bit. Will get better with practice.
Binary Tree was a little harder. Seeing the solution makes it clearer to me now. The correct solution is often very simple. Navigating the trees makes more sense now.
